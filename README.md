# Online DLibrarium 
Before the full presentation, I would like to first tell you the reason why I chose this topic. I noticed that over the past generations at the university, no matter how the university has changed, one thing remains unchanged - the students had to take books and return them, and it remains the same. Okay, we, programmers, whose items that would require a book made of paper can be counted with the finger of one hand. But do not forget that besides us, there are other specialties, which may still be obliged to take physical versions of books.
That is why I started thinking about the reason for this, and decided that there are several reasons:
1) It is inconvenient for the teacher to find a digital copy or scan a physical version to fill in a digital one.
2) Digital books can cost money, and those who distribute copies illegally run the risk of being sued

My proposal is to create a portal library strictly tied to our platform, on which books could be uploaded. Also, instead of burdening librarians with fiddling with students, it would be better to improve their work status so that they can be more productive on book logistics, and additionally advise beginners and not only teachers in a better way due to the (potential) vast book base.
